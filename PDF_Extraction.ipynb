            "    \"1  Background\": \"The risk of thromboembolic events is highest within the \\nfirst 3-6 months following bioprosthetic valve surgery [\\n1\\n]. \\nThe 2017 American Heart Association/American College \\nof Cardiology (AHA/ACC) Guidelines for the Management \\nof Patients with Valvular Heart Disease recommend anti-\\ncoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) to achieve \\nS. Pasciolla et al.\\nan international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 for at least \\n3 months or as long as 6 months after surgical bioprosthetic \\nmitral valve replacement (MVR) or aortic valve replacement \\n(AVR) in patients at low risk for bleeding (class IIa) [\\n1\\n]. \\nA large observational study evaluated the risk of thrombo-\\nembolic complications and cardiovascular death, as well \\nas bleeding rates, following bioprosthetic valve replace-\\nment surgery and found a higher incidence of thromboem-\\nbolic events in patients who discontinued warfarin within \\n6 months of surgery compared with those who remained on \\nanticoagulation with no difference in the rate of bleeding \\nevents between the two groups [\\n2\\n].\\nThe use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; apixaban, \\ndabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban) for anticoagulation has \\nincreased in recent years. DOACs are currently approved \\nfor the treatment of stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular \\natrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism treatment, and \\nprophylaxis for certain orthopedic procedures [\\n3\\n-\\n6\\n]. In \\nlarge, randomized controlled clinical trials, DOACs were \\nproven to be equally efficacious or superior to warfarin in \\nterms of thromboembolic events with an overall safer bleed-\\ning profile [\\n7\\n]. However, these clinical trials either did not \\ninclude or had very minimal representation of patients with \\nbioprosthetic valve replacements. Additionally, none of the \\npublished studies included patients with bioprosthetic valves \\nin the early postoperative phase (< 30 days after surgery).\\nThe ARISTOTLE trial evaluated apixaban (\\nn\\n = 9120) ver-\\nsus warfarin (\\nn\\n = 9081) in patients with atrial fibrillation [\\n3\\n]. \\nThat study included a small subset of patients with a history \\nof bioprosthetic valve replacements [\\nn\\n = 104 (0.6%)--aortic, \\nn\\n = 73; mitral, \\nn\\n = 26; mitral/aortic, \\nn\\n = 5] [\\n8\\n]. In analyzing \\nthis subset of patients, researchers found no differences in \\ninstances of major bleeding, stroke/systemic embolism, all-\\ncause mortality, or cardiovascular death between warfarin \\nand apixaban [\\n8\\n]. The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial, which \\nevaluated edoxaban (\\nn\\n = 14,069) versus warfarin (\\nn\\n = 7036) \\nin patients with atrial fibrillation [\\n4\\n], also included some \\npatients with a history of bioprosthetic valves (\\nn\\n = 191--\\nmitral, \\nn\\n = 131; aortic, \\nn\\n = 60) that were implanted >= 30 days \\nbefore randomization [\\n9\\n]. In that subgroup analysis, patients \\nin the edoxaban group had similar rates of stroke/systemic \\nembolic events with less bleeding compared with warfa-\\nrin. The authors concluded that edoxaban was a reasonable \\nalternative to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and \\nremote bioprosthetic valve implantation [\\n9\\n].\\nCurrently, there is no published literature available in \\npatients who received a bioprosthetic valve replacement and \\nare discharged on a DOAC in the early postoperative phase. \\nExploring the utility of using a DOAC in this patient popula-\\ntion may be clinically valuable despite current recommenda-\\ntions of using only a VKA. Due to the lack of evidence in \\nthis patient population, the purpose of this exploratory study \\nwas to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DOACs in patients \\nafter a recent bioprosthetic valve replacement.\",\n",
            "    \"2.1  Study Design\": \"ChristianaCare (CC) is a 1000-bed hospital that performs \\nover 700 open heart procedures each year. With regard to \\nbioprosthetic valve replacements, current practice at CC is \\nto start all patients on low-dose aspirin postoperatively, but \\nnot to initiate anticoagulation after bioprosthetic AVR and \\nMVR unless patients have or develop another indication for \\nanticoagulation (e.g. atrial fibrillation, venous thromboem-\\nbolism, etc.). Historically, cardiothoracic (CT) surgeons at \\nCC experienced more bleeding complications and a higher \\nrate of readmissions using warfarin in these patients. Thus, \\nthe decision to initiate anticoagulation after a bioprosthetic \\nvalve replacement is made on a case-by-case basis consider-\\ning the individual's risk of bleeding and thromboembolism, \\nat the discretion of the CT surgeon. If anticoagulation is \\ninitiated, then a DOAC or warfarin is used. Anticoagulation \\nis chosen based on the CT surgeon's preference with input \\nfrom a consulting cardiologist, taking into consideration fac-\\ntors such as preoperative anticoagulant and renal function. \\nAnticoagulation is initiated prior to discharge when deemed \\nsafe from a bleeding perspective, at the discretion of the CT \\nsurgeon.\\nA retrospective cohort study was performed to evaluate \\nanticoagulation in patients receiving bioprosthetic valve \\nreplacements from January 2014 to June 2018. Patients \\nwere included for study if they were >= 18 years of age and \\nreceived either warfarin or a DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, \\nrivaroxaban) following bioprosthetic AVR or MVR surgery. \\nEdoxaban was not included in the study due to low utiliza-\\ntion at CC, which also led to its removal from the formu-\\nlary. Patients had to be maintained on the same anticoagu-\\nlation agent throughout the 6-month follow-up period. The \\nduration was chosen based on the guideline recommenda-\\ntions for anticoagulation after bioprosthetic valve replace-\\nment [\\n1\\n]. Patients were excluded if they had a mechanical \\nvalve replacement, discontinued anticoagulation before the \\n6-month period ended, or switched anticoagulants during the \\n6-month period. This was determined based on documenta-\\ntion in the electronic medical record (EMR).\\nThe primary efficacy outcome was to assess thrombo-\\nembolic complications within 6 months following surgery. \\nThromboembolic complications were defined by a new diag-\\nnosis of ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and periph-\\neral arterial emboli, via the EMR. The primary safety out-\\ncome was to assess the incidence of major bleeding within \\nEfficacy and Safety of DOACs Vs. Warfarin After Bioprosthetic Valve Replacements\\n6 months following surgery. Major bleeding was defined by \\nthe Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC) \\n(Table \\n1\\n) or if identified by the EMR (e.g. written in the pro-\\ngress notes, Prothrombin Complex Concentrate  [Kcentra\\n(r)\\n] \\nadministered) [\\n10\\n]. Both the primary efficacy and safety \\nendpoints were evaluated based on readmissions to CC. \\nRates of readmission during the follow-up period were \\nassessed as a secondary outcome. Reasons for readmission \\nwere identified by the admitting diagnosis listed in the EMR. \\nComorbid conditions were collected using the International \\nClassification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions (ICD-\\n9, ICD-10) due to the time period over which data were \\ncollected.

            "    \"4  Discussion\": \"This exploratory study found similar rates of thromboem-\\nbolic complications and major bleeding events in patients \\nreceiving a DOAC or warfarin after bioprosthetic MVR \\nor AVR. These results are similar to what was seen in \\ntwo small, subgroup analyses from the ARISTOTLE and \\nENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trials [\\n8\\n, \\n9\\n].\\nThis study looked at a very specific patient population, \\ni.e. those receiving DOACs or warfarin after bioprosthetic \\nvalve replacement with an additional indication for antico-\\nagulation. The findings cannot be generalized to all patients \\nafter bioprosthetic valve replacement; however, the included \\npatients reflect a population that is commonly seen in clini-\\ncal practice. Atrial fibrillation (both pre- and postopera-\\ntively) was the indication for anticoagulation in over 90% \\nof the included patients. Atrial fibrillation is a common \\ncomorbidity found in patients prior to cardiac surgery, with \\na cited incidence rate of 11.5% [\\n11\\n]. Our population had \\nhigher rates of preoperative atrial fibrillation (around 50%) \\nsince we selected for those patients receiving anticoagula-\\ntion for an additional indication. In addition, postoperative \\natrial fibrillation is one of the most common complications \\nafter cardiac surgery, occurring anywhere from 25 to 45% of \\npatients, with a rate of 41.1% in our study specifically [\\n12\\n]. \\nTherefore, in clinical practice, it is not uncommon to come \\nacross patients who have had a recent bioprosthetic valve \\nreplacement and an additional indication for anticoagulation.\\nOverall, the patient populations in the warfarin and \\nDOAC groups were well matched. There were some differ-\\nences, such as a higher percentage of patients in the warfarin \\ngroup who had CKD and were receiving anticoagulation \\nprior to surgery. Even with these differences, the  CHA\\n2\\nDS\\n2\\nVASC and HAS-BLED scores were similar between the two \\ngroups, indicating the baseline thromboembolic risk and \\nbleeding risk were similar. More than half of the patients \\nin the DOAC group were receiving apixaban and only one \\npatient was receiving dabigatran, therefore the results of this \\nstudy cannot be generalized to all DOACs.\\nThere is an inherent bias on the decision to initiate a \\npatient on either warfarin or a DOAC; however, our explora-\\ntory study instead describes real-world practice. There were \\n12 patients dosed outside package insert recommendations \\nfor atrial fibrillation. All were receiving lower doses than \\nrecommended. Again, this reflects real-world practice where \\nalternative dosing strategies are sometimes used based on \\nclinical judgment.\\nWe acknowledge there are several limitations to this \\nstudy. A retrospective chart review will inherently have an \\ninferior level of evidence compared with prospective, ran-\\ndomized studies. This was an exploratory study, which was \\nnot powered to detect a difference between the two groups \\ndue to its small sample size. Only readmission data through \\nCC were available for review; we could not account for any \\nreadmissions outside of our health system, meaning we \\ncould have potentially missed thromboembolic and major \\nbleeding complications. In addition, as thromboembolic \\nand bleeding events were determined at readmission, any \\nevent that may have occurred during the index admission \\nwould not have been captured. For patients never readmit-\\nted to CC during the 6-month follow-up period, it cannot \\nbe determined that these individuals were maintained on \",\n",
            "    \"5  Conclusion\": \"This small, exploratory study found similar rates of throm-\\nboembolic complications and major bleeding events in \\npatients receiving a DOAC or warfarin within 6 months of \\nreceiving a bioprosthetic MVR or AVR. Larger, prospec-\\ntive trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of \\nDOACs in this population.\",\n",
